# roman-numeral-converter
Build a Roman numeral converter that takes a number between 1 and 3999 and converts it to its Roman numeral representation. The app should display appropriate error messages if the input is invalid, negative, or too large. The conversion should handle specific cases, such as 9 as 'IX', 16 as 'XVI', and 3999 as 'MMMCMXCIX'.
